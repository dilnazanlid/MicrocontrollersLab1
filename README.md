### Laboratory Work 1

Hello, my name is Dilnaz, and here I have **.ino** files and screenshots of the circuits for Lab 1 and Lab 2.

## Lab 1:

1. SOS

> Circuit consists of simple red LED and resistor connected to the ground and pin. It shows the SOS in Morse code as three short, three long and again three short signals. The time for signals can be adjusted via variables at the beginning of the code.

2. Pedestrian

> Circuit consists of simple three LEDs - red, yellow and green, and simulate the traffic lights for the pedestrians. Firstly, starts with turning on the red signal for 4 seconds(can be adjusted), then yellow for shorter time, and finally green - 5 seconds.

3. Traffic Lights

> Circuit consists of two breadboards for simplicity, and three LEDs each colored red, yellow and green. The task is to simulate the traffic lights for crossroad - weast-east and south-north. When red light is turned on one side, the green and then yellow LEDs for the other side is on. Then, signals switch, and the same pattern will be shown for the other road.

## Lab 2:

1. Switch debouncing

> In this exercise, I did a simple circuit with one LED and resistor, along with **push button** to control the state of the LED. According to the task, I initialized the variables to set the delay time between button pushes, so that continuously pressing the button for many times will be controlled using the time from the last push, and appropriate time delay between button pushes. The phenomenon is called *Switch bounce*.

2. Multiple switches

> The task is similar to the previous, however, the circuit became complex by adding the second **push button**, so that the LED state can be controlled using to buttons simultaneously.

3. Potentiometer

> Potentiometer is defined as a 3 terminal variable resistor in which the resistance is manually varied to control the flow of electric current, and it acts as an adjustable voltage divider. In this task I connected potentimeter and LED on one board, and controlled LED's brightness by changing the potentiometer value.

4. Photoresistors

> Photoresistors are a light-controlled variable resistors. It's resistance decrease when light intensity on the photoresistor is increased. In the task, we have photoresistor and LED on one board, so that when the light is increased, the LED's brightness desrease, and vice-versa.

5. Motion Sensor

> Motion sensors are used to evaluate the sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. As in the previous exercises, I constructed a circuit with LED and PIR motion sensor, so that when we simulate object motion within the sensor area, LED turn on, turning off only after some time the object has left the zone on motion.
