### Laboratory Work 1

Hello, my name is Dilnaz, and here I have **.ino** files and screenshots of the circuits for Lab 1 and Lab 2.

## Lab 1:

1. SOS

> Circuit consists of simple red LED and resistor connected to the ground and pin. It shows the SOS in Morse code as three short, three long and again three short signals. The time for signals can be adjusted via variables at the beginning of the code.

2. Pedestrian

> Circuit consists of simple three LEDs - red, yellow and green, and simulate the traffic lights for the pedestrians. Firstly, starts with turning on the red signal for 4 seconds(can be adjusted), then yellow for shorter time, and finally green - 5 seconds.

3. Traffic Lights

> Circuit consists of two breadboards for simplicity, and three LEDs each colored red, yellow and green. The task is to simulate the traffic lights for crossroad - weast-east and south-north. When red light is turned on one side, the green and then yellow LEDs for the other side is on. Then, signals switch, and the same pattern will be shown for the other road.

## Lab 2:

1. Switch debouncing

> In this exercise, I did a simple circuit with one LED and resistor, along with **push button** to control the state of the LED. According to the task, I initialized the variables to set the delay time between button pushes, so that continuously pressing the button for many times will be controlled using the time from the last push, and appropriate time delay between button pushes. The phenomenon is called *Switch bounce*.

2. Multiple switches

> The task is similar to the previous, however, the circuit became complex by adding the second **push button**, so that the LED state can be controlled using to buttons simultaneously.

3. Potentiometer
